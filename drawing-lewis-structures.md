# Lewis Structures


- Select the best Lewis structure from multiple possibilities based on formal charges. 
- Draw resonance structures and calculate fractional bond order.
- Define the following terms: Formal charge, Lewis structure, resonance, bond order.

When atoms combine to form compounds, they follow the [rules of valence](https://genchem.science.psu.edu/rules-valence).  The valence of an atom is the number of covalent bonds that it prefers to form with other atoms.  There are many exceptions, but this can be a useful place to start.

When representing molecules, we will use the Lewis model for drawing structures.  Lewis structures allow us to see the connectivity and placement of electrons in a molecule.

As you become familiar with drawing Lewis structures, you may find the following steps useful to have on hand.
