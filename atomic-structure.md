# Foundations 1: Atomic Structure

It is expected that you are familiar with the idea that atoms make up EVERYTHING and are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

The proton defines the identity of the element.  However, all the "business" takes place in the electron cloud.  Electrons are responsible for the properties of the elements and are used in forming chemical bonds.

We need to have a basic understanding of the structure of an atom.  This begins with understanding orbitals and how they are filled with electrons (electron configuration).  Ultimately, we need to be able to identify valence electrons as those are the ones that are involved in bonding.
