# Arrow Pushing in Organic Chemistry


In the upcoming lecture we will explore the structural and chemical properties of acids and bases. Before we can discuss these concepts we need to introduce a formalism for describing the movements of electrons that take place during chemical reactions. As you have seen previously, a chemical reaction is a rearrangement of valence electrons that leads to the cleavage and/or formation of bonds. The specific electron movements associated with each reaction are described by the reaction mechanism. Reaction mechanisms show where electrons originate in the reactant and where they ultimately reside in the product. This is represented graphically using a formalized system called arrow pushing in which the movement of electrons is diagrammed using a series of curved arrows. Arrow pushing diagrams adhere to the following rules:

1. Each arrow represents the movement of one pair of valence electrons.

2. Each arrow begins where the pair of electrons originates (either a lone pair of electrons or a bond) and ends where the electrons are going (either an atom or a bond).

3. An arrow that starts at an atom represents the movement of a lone pair of electrons.

4. An arrow that starts at the center of a bond represents the breaking of that bond.

5. An arrow that ends at an atom represents the formation of a new covalent bond or a new lone pair.

6. An arrow that ends at a bond represents adding of a bond to form a double (or triple) bond.

Applying the rules of arrow pushing so that they become second nature requires practice. Below are examples of mechanisms that are described by individual arrows. A few things worth pointing out are that the lone pair/bond moving is colored red in each example, and there is a separation of charge in either the reactants or products in each example.

> A. An arrow pointing from a single bond to an atom means that the bond breaks and a lone pair forms on the target atom.

> B. An arrow pointing from a lone pair to an atom means that the lone pair electrons form a new bond to the target atom.

> C. An arrow pointing from a double or triple bond to an atom means that _one_ of the bonds breaks, and those electrons form a new lone pair on the target atom.

> D. An arrow pointing from a lone pair to a bond means the lone pair electrons are used to increase the bond order of the target bond (e.g. a single bond becomes a double bond or a double bond becomes a triple bond).

As we have seen, many molecules contain atoms that carry full or partial charges. Reactions between molecules often occur when the electrons from an atom carrying a negative charge (full or partial) forms a bond with an atom in another molecule that carries a positive charge (full or partial). For reactions in which a bond is formed between atoms that were not previously bonded, the electron-rich atom from which the electrons originate is known as the nucleophile (Nu:) and the electron-deficient atom is known as the electrophile (E) (an example is shown in Figure 1). As their names imply, nucleophiles are attracted to nuclei and electrophiles are attracted to electrons (philos being Greek for love).

Another concept that is important in understanding reaction mechanisms is the leaving group (LG). This term is used to describe an atom or portion of a molecule that separates from a molecule as a result of a bond breaking during the course of a reaction. Leaving groups (colored green in the figure) always take both electrons from the broken bond with them as they depart (Figure 2).  Note that the net charge is the same on the left (reactant state) and right (product state) of the reaction.

Let us apply these concepts to the reaction of carbonic acid ($$H_2CO_3$$) with water to yield bicarbonate and a hydronium ion. The reaction mechanism is described using two arrows (see Figure 3). One arrow points from the lone pair of electrons on the water molecule to a hydrogen atom on carbonic acid. This arrow conveys the idea that the oxygen from water is using its lone pair electrons to form a bond with the hydrogen atom. Since hydrogen can only form one bond at a time, it must break its existing bond to oxygen. Breaking the existing O-H bond is represented by the second arrow, which points from the O-H bond in carbonic acid to the oxygen atom in the same O-H bond. This arrow conveys the idea that the O-H bond is breaking and that the electrons from that bond are being retained by carbonic acidâ€™s oxygen as a lone pair. In this reaction the oxygen in water is a nucleophile and the hydrogen in carbonic acid is an electrophile, as the oxygen in water is using its electrons to form a new bond and hydrogen is the recipient of those electrons. Finally, the remainder of the carbonic acid molecule ($$HCO_3^-$$) serves as a leaving group, as it results from the cleavage of the carbonic acid O-H bond and it takes a pair of electrons with it. Note that charge is balanced on both sides of the reaction.


### For more practice and examples, please look to the course textbook and the Tutorial on pages 174-181.  Then, review section 2.3 to see how curved arrows can be applied to acid-base reactions!  Practice identifying the electrophiles and nucleophiles in the examples provided!
