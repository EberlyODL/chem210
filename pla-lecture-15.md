# Diastereomers

So far we have studied compounds with only one chiral center.  Now, we are ready to look at compounds with more than one chiral center.  

When more than one chiral center is present, there is the potential for additional stereoisomers in the "family."  Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.  Because there is only ever one mirror image, a compound can only have 1 enantiomer.  A diastereomer is a compound that is not a mirror image, but is still non-superimposable.   The total number of stereoisomers of a compound is $$2^n$$ where $$n$$ is the number of stereocenters.

An example is shown below for 2-bromo-3-chlorobutane.  There are two chiral centers, so $$2^2$$ is 4 stereoisomers.  There are two pairs of enantiomers and every other pair would be described as diastereomers.  

When considering relationships between compounds, the first step is to first look at their connectivity.  If they have different connectivity, they would be constitutional isomers.  If they have the same connectivity, the compounds are either identical or stereoisomers.  Identical compounds will be superimposable (bonds may need to be rotated).  There are two types of stereoisomers: enantiomers and diastereomers.  If the compounds in question are nonsuperimposable mirror images, they are enantiomers.  If they are not mirror images, they are diastereomers. 

A quick way to determine stereoisomeric relationships is to determine the absolute configuration of each chiral center.  An enantiomeric pair will have the opposite configuration for **_every_** chiral center.  In figure 1 you can see that the (2R,3R) isomer is the enantiomer of the (2S,3S) isomer.  Likewise with (2R,3S) and (2S,3R).  When **_some_** (but not all) of the chiral centers are opposite, then the compounds are diastereomers.  (2R,3R) and (2R,3S) isomers would be diastereomers because one chiral center has the opposite configuration, but not all.

The textbook covers this topic in Chapter 4.10-11 and the problems within are excellent practice for the PLA questions.

A video from the Kahn academy walks through determining relationships of a series of compounds below.
