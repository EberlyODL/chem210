# Identifying Chiral Centers

Many organic molecules are **chiral**. If a compound is chiral, this means that it cannot be superimposed with its mirror image. Therefore, the compound and its mirror image are two unique compounds and are stereoisomers. We have discussed stereoisomers in the context of E/Z alkenes. Stereoisomers have the same connectivity, but differ in the arrangement of atoms in space.

Chiral centers (also known as stereocenters) are carbons that are attached to four different substituents. Shown In Figure 1 is a hypothetical molecule A, which is attached to four different atoms. When we reflect molecule A across the dotted line (mirror) we produce its mirror image, molecule B. Build a model of molecule A and B. Try to superimpose them on top of one another. Can you get all 4 groups to match? (Hint: If you can, you built one wrong! Try again.) Because these compounds are non-superimposable mirror images, they are chiral. These stereoisomers have a special relationship known as enantiomers. The enantiomer (non-superimposable mirror image) of molecule A is molecule B (and vice versa). The term enantiomer describes the relationship of two compounds. A compound can only have one enantiomer.

When looking for chiral centers, look for tetrahedral carbon atoms that are attached to four different substituent groups.

Let’s look at an example of a molecule that is not chiral. The hypothetical molecule C is shown in Figure 2. It is attached to a red atom, a gray atom, and two green atoms; it is therefore attached to only three different substituents (two of the substituents are both green atoms). When we reflect molecule C across the dotted line we produce its mirror image, molecule D. Build a model of these two and try to superimpose them. You should be able to! Molecule C is **achiral** (not chiral) because it can be superimposed with its mirror image.  Therefore, molecule C and D are the same (identical).

Shown in Figure 3 is an example of a chiral molecule, 2-bromobutane. This molecule cannot be superimposed with its mirror image.

Note that the chiral carbon is attached to four different substituents: a hydrogen atom, a bromine atom, a “$$CH_3$$” group, and a “$$CH_2CH_3$$" group. Even though the chiral carbon is attached to two carbons, these carbons are distinguishable from each other (“$$CH_3$$” is not the same as “$$CH_2CH_3$$”).
