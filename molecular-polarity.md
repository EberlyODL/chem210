# Molecular Polarity

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able to…_
* Use molecular geometry and electronegativity differences to determine whether a molecule will have an overall dipole moment.

We're going to take what we know about bond polarity and molecular shape to identify whether or not a molecule is polar.

Earlier, we encountered dipole moment in the context of polar covalent bonds. In that context we saw that in a polar bond partial charges ($$\delta$$) are separated to opposite ends of the bond, with one end being positive and the other end being negative. We also saw that some bonds are more polar than others. To make these comparisons we can experimentally measure the size of the dipole moment. The dipole moment (abbreviated with the lower-case Greek letter mu, $$\mu$$) equals the amount of charge that is being separated (i.e., the partial charges) times the distance over which those charges are being separated (i.e., the bond distance). 

> $$\mu = \delta\text r$$

Now, we will examine dipole moments for complete molecules, rather than for isolated bonds. A molecule is polar if there is a net separation of charge between two “ends” or “sides” of the molecule. In other words, a polar molecule is one that has a negative “end” and a positive “end”. In order for a molecule to be polar (to have a net dipole) it must have polar bonds, and the geometries of those bonds must not cause them to cancel each other out (i.e., they can’t be pointed in opposite directions or in directions where they add to zero, which in some cases may not be exactly opposite, such as in the case of trigonal planar molecules). 

To determine the polarity of a molecule you should start by drawing the Lewis structure. Then use the Lewis structure to determine the molecular geometry of the molecule. Next, draw in the dipoles for each bond in the structure. The formalism that is used for this is to show a dipole using an arrow with a cross at its tail. The arrow head points towards the negative end of the dipole (the direction in which electrons are more attracted), and the tail (which resembles a plus sign) points towards the positive end of the dipole. Once you’ve drawn out the dipoles you need to decide whether the dipoles cancel (i.e., whether or not they point in opposite directions). 

Figure 1 shows the example of water. If you write out the Lewis structure of water it will have two lone pairs on the central oxygen. That will give it a tetrahedral electron domain geometry and a bent molecular geometry. Next, I drew in the individual bond dipoles (green and light blue arrows). The bond dipoles point towards oxygen since oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen. For the final step, I need to decide whether the dipoles point in the opposite direction or not. As is always the case for bent molecules, they don’t; thus the molecule is polar. The purple arrow shows the net dipole for the molecule. This dipole represents the sum of the two individual bond dipoles (that is, the bond dipoles were positioned head to tail, as shown with the dotted blue line, and the purple arrow is given by the path connecting the tail of the first (green) arrow to the head of the second (blue) arrow. This is referred to as the “vector sum” of the dipoles—a term you may recall if you’ve taken physics. The distribution of charge in the molecule is shown in the colored model at the bottom of the figure (red = more negative; blue = more positive). If you look carefully you’ll see the stick model of water beneath the colored surface. Notice that the color gradient in the model follows the direction of the purple dipole arrow, with the arrow head being oriented near the negative end of the molecule and the tail of the arrow being oriented near the positive end of the molecule and bisecting the angle between the two hydrogen atoms.
