# Cationic v. anionic polymerization


Polymerization can occur by three possible mechanisms:

1. Free radicals
2. Cationic
3. Anionic

As we saw, **free radical polymerization** has essentially the same mechanistic steps as radical halogenation of an alkane.  Most alkenes will undergo radical polymerization if the conditions are appropriate.  The presence of a radical initiator like peroxides or AIBN are required.

For **cationic polymerization** to occur, the alkene needs to have an electron donating group that will stabilize the carbocation intermediate that is formed in the reaction.  (We initially looked at electron donors and withdrawers way back in Chapter 7.  We revisited this concept when explaining the reactivity of carbonyl derivatives (esters, acid chlorides, amides, ketones, etc.))  The generic mechanism for cationic polymerization is shown below.  We will look at the details of this polymerization in the next class session.

Unlike cationic polymerization, **anionic polymerization** is only efficient when the alkene contains electron withdrawing groups.   The mechanism is believed to occur as shown below.  Again, we will dig into the details of the mechanism in the next class session.

For now, I ask that you identify the best method of polymerization given a monomer or polymer based on the functional groups attached.  When looking at a polymer, first identify the monomer and then determine if the substituent group(s) is(are) electron donating or electron withdrawing.
