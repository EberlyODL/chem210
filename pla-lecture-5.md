# Hybridization

Hybridization is the idea that atomic orbitals (s and p) mix to form hybrid orbitals.  This theory _explains_ some of the experimental measurements of bond lengths and angles in molecules.

The number of domains about an atom determines the type of orbitals used in forming sigma bonds or holding lone pairs (for a review of what constitutes a "domain," check out the foundations section on [electron domain geometry](/vsepr-theory.md)).  


## $$sp^3$$ Hybridization

$$sp^3$$ hybridization results from the mixing of a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals.  Since four orbitals are mixed, you end up with four $$sp^3$$ hybrid orbitals.  Most atoms with four domains will be $$sp^3$$ hybridized.  (We will discuss exceptions when we look at resonance in more detail in a week or two.)

## $$sp^2$$ Hybridization

$$sp^2$$ hybridization results from the mixing of a 2s orbital and two 2p orbitals.  Since three orbitals are mixed, you end up with three $$sp^2$$ hybrid orbitals. There will be an atomic p orbital that remains unhybridized.  This p orbital will be empty or involved in a pi bond. Most atoms with three domains will be $$sp^2$$ hybridized.
