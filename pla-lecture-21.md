# Alkene Stability

In the next class session we will begin to look at a class of organic reactions known as **elimination reactions**.  Elimination reactions involve the loss of H and a leaving group to form an alkene (see Figure 1 below).  (Note that this is the reverse of the addition reactions we have learned.)

Usually, the major product of an elimination reaction is the more stable alkene.  Now would be a good time to discuss what makes some alkenes more stable than others!  Alkene stability is related to the degree of substitution.  You have seen how we classify alcohols,  alkyl halides, and even carbocations as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the number of alkyl substituents.  Similarly, alkenes can be classified by the total number of alkyl substituents attached to both carbons of the double bond.  Monosubstituted alkenes have one substituent on a carbon of the double bond.  Disubstituted have two groups, trisubstituted have three groups, and tetrasubstituted have four groups (Figure 2).  Disubstituted alkenes can actually come in three flavors - cis, trans, or neither.  

The stability of alkenes increases as the number of alkyl substituents increases (Figure 3). This conclusion is made by interpreting data collected from heats of hydrogenation. (See section 5.6 of the text for more details. However, know that we will not focus on how this data was obtained.)  The order of stability can be explained with **hyperconjugation**.  Sigma bonds next door to the double bond can donate electron density to the more electronegative $$sp^2$$ hybridized atom. (Connect this to the difference in acidity for alkane, alkene, and alkyne C-H bonds.)  Donating to more electronegative atoms is stabilizing!

To differentiate the stability of disubstituted alkenes, we must consider other factors.  Cis alkenes are less stable than trans alkenes which have a similar stability to alkenes where both substituents are on the same carbon of the double bond (Figure 4).  Steric effects come in to play when the substituent groups are on the same side of the alkene - they are bumping into each other!
