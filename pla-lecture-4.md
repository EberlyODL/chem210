# Resonance

### Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the [third Foundations module](/drawing-structures.md) on drawing structures.



Resonance will be an important consideration for us in the course.  We will first see resonance theory applied to acid-base chemistry.  

There are four basic patterns of resonance to watch for.  One of these patterns was seen in the foundational review. 

There will be resonance when:
> 1) lone pairs are adjacent to a double (or triple) bond
> 2) lone pairs or double bonds are adjacent to positive charge
> 3) a double (or triple) bond exists between two atoms of differing electronegativities
> 4) there are alternating double-single bonds in a closed ring (i.e. benzene)
