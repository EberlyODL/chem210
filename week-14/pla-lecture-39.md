# Radicals and Stability


Look at that - we're going to talk about stability AGAIN!!!

Why???  Because stability explains A LOT of things in organic chemistry!  And organic chemistry is all around us (even IN us!!!).

Radicals are intermediates in a chemical reaction like carbocations or carbanions.  They don't exist for a long time and they are highly reactive. Radicals, however, are neutral and have a single, unpaired electron. 

Carbon radicals can be classified in the same way as carbocations: primary, secondary, or tertiary.  When radicals are next to alkenes or benzene rings, they can also be termed allylic or benzyllic.

Carbon radicals have an unpaired electron giving them only 7 electrons, one shy of an octet.  **_Does this make them electron rich or electron poor?_**

Of course, they are electron poor (only have 7 but want 8 electrons).  Since both carbocations and radicals are electron deficient, it is not surprising that they will follow the same stability trend (see Chapter 14.3). Allylic and benzylic radicals are more stable due to resonance (again, the same as carbocations!).

    most stable $$3^o >  2^o  >  1^o$$ least stable
