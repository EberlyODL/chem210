# Orbital Filling

There are a series of rules that are followed when placing electrons into orbitals to give the ground state (most stable) electron configuration of an atom.

# Classification of Electrons

Electrons within an atom can be classified into three categories:
* Inner (core) electrons
* Outer electrons
* Valence electrons

It will soon be important to identify types of electrons, especially those that are valence, because those are used in bonding.
