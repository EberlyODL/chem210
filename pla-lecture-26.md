# PLA Lecture 26

There's not really any additional reading this time.  Take the time to make sense of the reactivity patterns that determine the major mechanistic pathway for alkyl halides.  There is some practice in the question set!

We are moving into a unit on the reactivity of carboxylic acids and derivatives such as acid chlorides, anhydrides, esters, and amides.  We will be looking at inductive and resonance donating or withdrawing effects of substituent groups.  Revisit Chapter 7.9 and identify the types of groups that are donors or withdrawers.  In a similar way that these substituents influenced the acidity of groups on an aromatic ring, they will also have an effect on the reactivity of the carboxylic acid derivatives!  Stay tuned!!!
