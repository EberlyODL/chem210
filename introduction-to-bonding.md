# Introduction to Bonding
**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* Recognize and describe the types of bonding.
* Identify whether a compound is ionic or molecular. 
* Describe the octet rule and draw Lewis dot symbols for elements/ions. 


It's important to note that bonding does not simply occur to satisfy some empirical rules.  _Atoms form bonds to reach a lower energy. When a bond forms, energy will be released ($$\Delta$$E < 0)._
Filled-shell noble gas configurations are especially stable due to their perfectly spherical distribution of electron density.  In order to achieve a noble gas configuration, atoms must gain, lose, or share electrons.  Most atoms want to achieve an "octet" where there are eight electrons in its valence shell.
As we will see in the following sections, there are two types of bonds: ionic and covalent. In ionic bonds, ions with noble gas configurations and opposite charges are attracted to one another and come together to form ionic solids.  In covalent bonds, electrons are shared between atoms.  These electrons are attracted to both nuclei simultaneously. 

For a recap of identifying valence electrons in an atom and an overview of drawing Lewis structures of main group elements, check out the video below!  (Note: You do not need to be able to draw Lewis dot structures for transition metals.)
