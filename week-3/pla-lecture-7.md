# Hydrocarbons


Organic molecules are enormously diverse, owing to the fact that carbon forms strong, stable bonds to other carbon atoms and to other atoms like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and the halogens. Carbon also forms four bonds simultaneously, which allows for complex, branched molecules. Carbon is also capable of forming bonds with higher bond orders, adding even more diversity to the organic molecules that exist. 

Hydrocarbons are a class of compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. This large family of compounds is further broken down into subcategories:

1) Alkanes
- Contain C-C single bonds with a general molecular formula of $$C_nH_{2n+2}$$

2) Cycloalkanes
- Contain C-C single bonds in a ring.  When there is only one ring, the general molecular formula is $$C_nH_{2n}$$


3) Alkenes
- Contain C-C double bonds.  When there is just one double bond, the general molecular formula is $$C_nH_{2n}$$


4) Alkynes
- Contain C-C triple bonds. When there is one triple bond, the molecule has a general molecular formula of $$C_nH_{2n-2}$$


5) Aromatic
- Contain alternating single-double-single-double bonds in a ring
