# E/Z Nomenclature of Alkenes

We are familiar with the _cis_ and _trans_ nomenclature for simple alkenes.  However, this designation isn't enough when there are four different groups on the double bond.

We will use the E/Z system of nomenclature to identify these alkenes.  It's easy!  We will look at each atom directly attached to the carbons of the double bond and assign a priority according to atomic number.  If the high-priority groups are on the same side, that will be _Z_ from the German word zusammen, meaning together.  If the high-priority groups are on opposite sides, that will be an _E_ alkene for the German word entgegen, meaning opposite.

Check out the video below with several examples of how to apply the rules.  We will do another practice problem or two in lecture.  These rules will come back again when we determine _R_ or _S_ configuration of chiral centers on Friday.


**For additional background and practice, please refer to Chapter 4.1-4.2 of the text and the problems within.**
