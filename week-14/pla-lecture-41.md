# Radical Reactions & Selectivity

Review your class notes from Monday.  You need to be able to identify mechanistic steps as initiation, propagation, and termination and determine the major product of a radical halogenation reaction based on an understanding of radial stability.


# Polymers

We'll be sliding right into polymers.  Many polymers are formed via radical reactions.  For now, I want you to practice determining the polymer structure from monomers and vice versa.  There is a good overview of polymer stuff in section 15.1 and 15.2 of the textbook.  Try problem 1!
