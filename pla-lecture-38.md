# Aldol Reaction Practice

Two aldehydes or ketones react under basic conditions to produce an aldol product known as a $$\beta$$-hydroxyaldehyde.  The $$\alpha-\beta$$ bond is the "new" bond formed in the reaction (shown in red in the figure below).  Review your class notes and practice drawing aldol products with problem 12 in Chapter 13 of the textbook.

Intramolecular aldols can occur when there are two carbonyls in the same molecule.  In the example below, a 1.4-diketone can form two different enolates.  One leads to a 5-membered ring, and the other to a 3-membered ring.  The 5-membered ring is the only product produced due to its greater stability.

Generally, the formation of 5- or 6- membered rings is favorable.  Anything smaller or larger is more difficult.  When there is a  choice of ring size, choose the most stable ring as the major product.

Take some time to practice with the two questions in canvas.  Please ask questions if you have any! :)
