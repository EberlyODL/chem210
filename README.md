# Organic Foundations


There are 5 core content areas from general chemistry that are important foundations to determining the reactivity and properties of organic compounds.

1) Atomic Structure
    - Orbitals
    - Electron Configuration
    
    
2) Chemical Bonding
    - Intro to Bonding
    - Ionic Compounds
    - Covalent Compounds
    - Bond Polarity & Electronegativity
    - Valence Bond Theory
    
    
3) Drawing Structures
    - Formal Charge
    - Lewis Structure
    - Exceptions to the octet rule
    - Resonance
    
    
4) Molecular Shape
    - VSEPR Theory
    - Molecular Geometry
    - Molecular polarity

5) Acids and Bases

There are links embedded throughout the review to the CHEM 110/112 ebook, so if you purchased that, you will be able to use those as a resource if you wish.  Any other General Chemistry text can serve as a reference for this material if you do not have access.  Another good resource may be this free ebook _[Preparation for Organic Chemistry](https://bit.ly/prepbook)_ by David Reingold.
  
At the end of each content area, you will find a link back to canvas asking you to complete a problem set.  You can attempt this problem set as many times as you like.  Only the highest score will be recorded.  Your score on these 5 practice sets will account for 25 points of your Foundations score.  The remaining 25 points will come from a 45-minute quiz available at the Pollock testing center August 28-29.
