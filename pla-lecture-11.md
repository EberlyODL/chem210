# Newman Projections

Carbon-carbon single bonds can freely rotate.  This results in an infinite number of conformations or "stops" as you rotate the bond.  We are going to be the most concerned with the highest and lowest energy conformations.  We can represent the various 3D conformations with Newman projections.

Build a model of ethane and follow along with the video embedded below.  Then, head back to canvas to answer a few questions about interpreting Newman projections.  You will use your model kit for the question set.  After some practice with the model kit, you will get more comfortable seeing these in three dimensions!

**Review section 3.9 in the text for some additional practice problems.**
