# Orbitals

An orbital is a region of space that can be occupied by electron density. In this case, we are thinking of an electron as a wave.  The wave-nature of the electron can be characterized by a wavefunction calculated from the Schrodinger equation.  The 3D region of space we know as an orbital is determined by taking the square of the wavefunction.

## Orbital Characteristics

There are two basic shapes of orbitals that we will need to be familiar with.  They are a sphere and a dumbbell that correspond to the s and p orbitals, respectively.

Aside from the shapes and sizes of orbitals, let's explore some further details of orbitals!
